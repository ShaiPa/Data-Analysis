# # Create a histogram of the price of

# =======================================
qplot(data = diamonds, x=price)
summary(diamonds$price)

# How many diamonds cost less then $500?
table(diamonds$price < 500)

# How many diamonds cost less then $250?
table(diamonds$price < 250)

# How many diamonds cost eual to more then $15000?
table(diamonds$price >= 15000)

# Explore the largest peak in the
# price histogram you created earlier.

# Try limiting the x-axis, altering the bin width,
# and setting different breaks on the x-axis.

# There wonâ€™t be a solution video for this

# You can save images by using the ggsave() command.
# ggsave() will save the last plot created.
# For example...
#                  qplot(x = price, data = diamonds)
#                  ggsave('priceHistogram.png')

# ggsave currently recognises the extensions eps/ps, tex (pictex),
# pdf, jpeg, tiff, png, bmp, svg and wmf (windows only).

# Submit your final code when you are ready.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# ======================================================================

# Break out the histogram of diamond prices by cut.

# You should have five histograms in separate
# panels on your resulting plot.

# TYPE YOUR CODE BELOW THE LINE
# ======================================================

  facet_wrap(~cut)

# Diamond prices by cut
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, max)
by(diamonds$price, diamonds$cut, min)

# In the two last exercises, we looked at
# the distribution for diamonds by cut.

# Run the code below in R Studio to generate
# the histogram as a reminder.

# ===============================================================

qplot(x = price, data = diamonds) + facet_wrap(~cut)

# ===============================================================

# In the last exercise, we looked at the summary statistics
# for diamond price by cut. If we look at the output table, the
# the median and quartiles are reasonably close to each other.

# diamonds$cut: Fair
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     337    2050    3282    4359    5206   18570 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
# diamonds$cut: Good
#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     327    1145    3050    3929    5028   18790 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

#    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#     336     912    2648    3982    5373   18820

# This means the distributions should be somewhat similar,
# but the histograms we created don't show that.

# The 'Fair' and 'Good' diamonds appear to have 
# different distributions compared to the better
# cut diamonds. They seem somewhat uniform
# on the left with long tails on the right.

# Let's look in to this more.

# Look up the documentation for facet_wrap in R Studio.
# Then, scroll back up and add a parameter to facet_wrap so that
# the y-axis in the histograms is not fixed. You want the y-axis to
# be different for each histogram.

# If you want a hint, check out the Instructor Notes.
